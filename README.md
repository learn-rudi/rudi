## AI Readiness Assessment

The assessment system allows organizations to:

1. Generate a custom assessment link with their organization name
2. Share the link with team members
3. Collect anonymous responses (only org name is tracked)
4. Optionally leave contact info for follow-up

Assessment data is collected via Tally.so forms.
